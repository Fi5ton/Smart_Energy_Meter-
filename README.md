# Smart_Energy_Meter-
The project summarizes the development of a Smart Energy Meter for monitoring electrical consumption and detection of abnormal usage patterns that indicate electricity theft. The system utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller, an ACS712 current sensor, and relay for automated power disconnection
Its main features include real-time recording of current, power, and cumulative energy (kWh), along with an alarm facility triggering a visual (Virtual Terminal message) and audio (variable-rate buzzer) signal on detecting consumption above a specified threshold. The project is aimed at making monitoring of electricity and minimizing losses of electricity addressed at minimal cost and in an efficient manner, particularly in the case of Rwanda and East Africa where power theft and inefficient use of energy are likely to be very serious issues.
